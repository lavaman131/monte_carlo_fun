# ðŸŽ² Monte Carlo Fun

## ðŸ“– Description
This repository contains a Monte Carlo simulation project. Monte Carlo methods are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### ðŸ“¦ Setup
The project is implemented in Python 3.10. The dependencies are managed using Poetry. To install the dependencies, run the following commands:

```bash
# navigate to the project directory
cd src
# create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
# install the dependencies
poetry install
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage

Check out the [`src/utils`](./src/utils) directory for the implementation of the Monte Carlo simulations.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

The results and analysis of the Monte Carlo simulations are visualized in the [`analysis.ipynb`](./notebooks/analysis.ipynb) file.
